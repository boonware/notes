# Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms

Set theory is built on the postulate that there is a fundamental _relation_, i.e. a predicate of two variables, called $\in$ (epsilon). A definition of $\in$ is not given, nor is the definition of a set, rather there are nine axioms which speak of $\in$ and sets. These axioms may be remembered with the mnemonic "EE PURP IC F".



* EE - Basic existence axioms.
* PURP - Construction axioms.
* IC - Further existence axioms.
* F - Non-existence axioms.
