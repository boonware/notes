# Special Relativity


## Galilean Relativity
In classical mechanics, we can translate the position or velocity between two different inertial frames of reference, $S$ and $S'$, using what we call the Galilean transformations. Assuming that we start our clock when the the origins of the two frames coincide, that is the time $t_0=0$, and that the frames are moving relative to each other at a speed $v$ in the y-direction, then at a later time $t_1$ the frames are separated by a distance $vt_1$ in the y-direction.

## Michelson-Morley Experiment
James Clerk Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, published in 1861, described light as a wave and predicted the speed of light $c$ in a vacuum as

$$
    c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}} \approx 3 \times 10^{8} ms^{-1}
$$

where $\epsilon_0$ and $\mu_0$ are the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the vacuum, respectively. But if light is a wave, in what medium does it travel through the vacuum? Mechanical waves that we are familiar with, such as a wave moving through water or sound through air, travel though a medium, so it was postulated that light travels through the "luminiferous aether", a substance that permeated all of space.

The Michelson-Morley experiment (1887) attempted to measure the motion of the Earth relative to this aether by interferring two beams of light, one which travelled parallel to the Earth's motion around the Sun ($B_1$) and one which travelled perpendicular ($B_2$). An interference pattern was expected due to the relative motion of the Earth and $B_1$ in the same direction changing the speed that $B_1$ travelled.

No interference pattern was observed, which cast doubt on the existence of the aether. If light travels in a medium, how can its speed be constant when measured in reference frames with different velocities relative to this medium?


## Einstein's Postulates
In 1905 Albert Einstein postulated the following:

1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.
2. The speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames.

The implications of these two postulates are profound.


## Lorentz Contraction

To rescue the idea of the aether, Hendrik Lorentz (1891) and George Francis Fitzgerald (1889) postulated _length contraction_.
