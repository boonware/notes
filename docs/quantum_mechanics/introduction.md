# Introduction

## What is Quantum Mechanics?
Quantum mechanics is the study of the fundamental working of Nature on the smallest scales, that of atoms, molecules, particles and below.

## History

### 19th Century Physics
To begin to understand quantum mechanics it is instructive to understand the history of how the theory came about. By the end of the 19th century, all of physics was ultimately described by two foundational theories, **Newtonian Mechanics** and **Electromagnetism**. Newtonian mechanics, based on the foundations of Isaac Newton and others in the 17th century, described matter and its motion, summarized by Newton's famous equation:

$$
  \vec{F} = m \frac{ \mathrm{d} \vec{p} }{\mathrm{dt}} = m \vec{a}
$$

 The theory of Electromagnetism, expressed by the equations of James Clerk Maxwell earlier in the 19th century, described electromagnetic radiation. The two theories were bridged by the **Lorentz Force Law**, which described how matter and electromagnetic waves interacted.

$$
  \vec{F} = q \left( \vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B} \right)
$$

Crucially, particle and wave properties were **mutually exclusive**: matter never behaved like a wave, electromagnetic radiation never behaved like a particle. However, there were a few unsolved problems ...
