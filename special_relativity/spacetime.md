## The Spacetime Interval
When we speak of an _event_ we speak of something that occurs at a point in space and at a particular moment in time. Now consider a signal propagating at the speed of light $c$. The signal begins at time $t_1$ at coordinates $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ in the reference frame $K$, and eventually reaches a point $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ at time $t_2$. The distance travelled between the two events is $c \Delta t$ but by the Pythagorean theorem the following must be true:

$$
    (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + (\Delta z)^2 - c^2(\Delta t)^2 = 0
$$

We can also measure these events in another reference frame $K'$ where the signal begins at time $t'_1$ at coordinates $(x'_1,y'_1,z'_1)$ and arrives at the point $(x'_2,y'_2,z'_2)$ at time $t'_2$. By the same reasoning above we have:

$$
    (\Delta x')^2 + (\Delta y')^2 + (\Delta z')^2 - c^2(\Delta t')^2 = 0
$$

We see that this interval, for two events in the propagation of a signal travelling at the speed of light, is always zero in any reference frame. Now consider two arbitrary events separated in space and time. We define the _spacetime interval_ for these events as the difference between the separation of the events in space and the distance light would travel in the time between the events:

$$
    (\Delta s)^2 = (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + (\Delta z)^2 - c^2(\Delta t)^2 
$$

For events that are infinitessimally close in space and time we can define:

$$
    (ds)^2 = (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 + (dz)^2 - c^2(dt)^2 
$$
